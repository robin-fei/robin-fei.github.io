### Life

* You don’t need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn’t wait. Just don’t wait. —— Paul Graham, [Life is Short](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html)

* Ideas don’t come out fully formed. They only become clear as you work on them. You just have to get started. 有关使命感的种种想法常常是不成熟的、不完整的，这些想法只有在实践中才能逐渐变得清晰，你只需要开始行动就好。 —— Mark Zuckerberg, Co-founder and CEO of Facebook
